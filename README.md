## My process

- Created new Vite + React project.
- Installed Sass as a dependency.
- Initialized git repo and pushed project to GitHub.
- Created general styles for the app.
- Deployed project to live site in Netlify.
- Built page with grid layout
- Added animations using Framer motion to cards
- Optimized page layout for different screen sizes
- Created Skeleton loading effect for cards.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass/Scss](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS preprocessor
- [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - React animation library
- [React Loading Skeleton](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loading-skeleton) React library for creating skeleton UI loaders

### What I learned

CSS grid is something I always find myself running from in project. This challenge presented the perfect oppotunity to face it head on. I was able to understand more about how the grid works and how to create complex but responsive grid layouts.

I even decided to take it further and decided to learn through this project, how to incoperate Framer motion and React Loading Skeleton for animations and skeleton loading effects respectively in my react applications.
